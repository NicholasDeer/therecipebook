small html project creating a few recipes
this project will be, in large part, a review of the basics html syntax i've learned.

Created html boilerplate from memory.
Not sure if I've done it correctly but it was fun trying. 
Out of a desire to see how much I've learned, I've choosen not to review whether my boilerplate is correct until the end of the project.

Created a recipe page (waffles.html).
Filled in waffles.html with description, ordered and unordered lists, and img and src w/ alt.
